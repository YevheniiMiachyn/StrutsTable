Caesium is also gold coloured. The gold colour seems related to relativistic effects of the outermost gold orbitals. Small amounts of other metals alloyed with gold change the colour as well as mechanical properties such as hardness. White gold for jewellery is formed by mixing palladium silver or nickel with gold although the result is green gold with certain proportions of silver. White gold is commonly used for wedding rings in the USA. Addition of some copper gives ""rose gold"" a soft pink colour.
